## Initial setup

Login to the system using your preferred Google account. There is currently no restriction on who can add metadata records.

Once you have logged in, select the CIOOS region that the data was collected within. If the data spans more than one region, select the region whose Regional Association you have been working with. The region selection will be used to notify a reviewer from that region to review the record once you have submitted the completed record for review. As you add records, please ensure you have filled out contact information for the metadata contact as the reviewer will use this to contact you with any questions about the metadata entry.

After selecting your region, click New Record to begin. The sections of the metadata form to fill in are listed as separate tabs across the top of the page. The sections below describe how to fill in the entries within each of these tabs. Many of these elements will translate to entries shown in CKAN, the CIOOS metadata catalogue. An example CKAN record for an existing dataset can be viewed [here](https://cioosatlantic.ca/ckan/dataset/org-coastalaction_ec2b8fbb-5482-46e2-af71-9e85d58b8922). In some cases we will also refer to the CIOOS asset map, which can be viewed as the map-based dataset browser, which is shown on the main CIOOS home page [here](https://cioos.ca).

Note that many of the elements have bilingual requirements. A 'Translate' button can be used to automatically translate the text you've entered in French or English into the other language, using AWS translation tools. 

Contact a member of the CIOOS engagement team within your region if you have questions about how to fill in any of these fields.

## Identification

### Title

This will define the dataset title, which corresponds to the header shown in CKAN for the dataset.

### Abstract

Enter the abstract for the dataset. These will define the summary text that is shown for this dataset in CKAN, so browsing some datasets at [](https://cioosatlantic.ca/ckan) can help give a sense of the type of descriptions that are typically used for this.

Suggested abstract points:
* **What:** Variables that were measured.
* **When:** Temporal coverage of the data, frequency of the measurements/observations.
* **Where:** spatial coverage of the data, sampling sites, sensor tracks, laboratory spaces
* **How:** equipment, procedures, protocols, calibrations, QA/QC.
* **Who:** participants, staff.
* **Why:** a high level statement on the outcome this data is meant to inform. 

### Essential ocean variables

The essential ocean variables (EOVs) specified here will be relied on for searching and filtering for this dataset within the CIOOS metadata catalogue and asset map. Review the types of data that are present in the dataset and select the CIOOS EOVs that describe these data types.

More information about the CIOOS essential ocean variables that youâ€™d like to associate with this dataset can be found [here](https://cioosatlantic.ca/eovs/). You can also find out more about the wider EOV list used by the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOD) [here](https://www.goosocean.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=14&Itemid=114).

### Keywords

Including information about the data types present in the dataset using standard vocabularies such as [Climate and Forecast names](https://cfconventions.org/) or the [BODC Parameter Usage Vocabulary](https://www.bodc.ac.uk/resources/vocabularies/parameter_codes/) are of particular interest. [GCMD keywords](http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/P04/current/) are also useful, however these can be automatically generated from the Climate and Forecast names, if those are provided.
